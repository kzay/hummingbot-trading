# Game Day - 2026-02-22

## Scenario
Controlled partial outage drill focused on Redis unavailability in the external control-plane.

## Objective
- Validate fail-closed behavior under control-plane degradation:
  - promotion remains blocked
  - incident evidence is emitted
  - recovery is repeatable with explicit operator steps

## Preconditions
- External profile running from reproducible control-plane image (`hbot-control-plane:20260222`).
- Strict cycle automation available: `scripts/release/run_strict_promotion_cycle.py`.

## Drill Timeline (UTC)
1. **00:46:55** - Pre-outage strict cycle executed.
   - Evidence: `reports/promotion_gates/game_day_mHSZ_pre_outage.json`
   - Result: `FAIL` with `critical_failures=["day2_event_store_gate"]` (expected baseline blocker).
2. **~00:47:10** - Redis stopped (`docker compose ... stop redis`).
3. **00:47:26** - Strict cycle executed during outage.
   - Evidence: `reports/promotion_gates/game_day_20260221T194822Z_redis_down.json`
   - Result: `FAIL` with `critical_failures=["day2_event_store_gate"]`.
4. **~00:48:40** - Redis recovered (`docker compose ... up -d redis`) and health waited to `healthy`.
5. **00:49:14** - Post-recovery strict cycle executed.
   - Evidence: `reports/promotion_gates/game_day_20260221T194914Z_post_recovery.json`
   - Result: `FAIL` with `critical_failures=["day2_event_store_gate"]` (returns to baseline failure set).

## Operator Commands Used
- `python scripts/release/run_strict_promotion_cycle.py --append-incident-on-fail`
- `docker compose --env-file ../env/.env --profile external -f docker-compose.yml stop redis`
- `docker compose --env-file ../env/.env --profile external -f docker-compose.yml up -d redis`
- `docker compose --env-file ../env/.env --profile external -f docker-compose.yml ps redis`

## Outcomes
- **Fail-closed promotion path confirmed**:
  - strict cycle status remained `FAIL` throughout drill and recovery.
  - no promotion pass occurred during degraded conditions.
- **Actionable incident logging confirmed**:
  - incident notes appended in `docs/ops/incidents.md`.
- **Recovery repeatability confirmed**:
  - stop/recover/health-check/runbook command sequence worked as expected.

## Observed Gaps / Follow-Ups
- Existing Day 2 blocker masks additional outage-specific critical failures in strict summary.
- Follow-up for next game day iteration:
  - run an outage drill with temporary Day 2 gate bypass in a dedicated test profile to isolate outage-specific gate behavior.
  - extend drill to include explicit stream-lag and consumer backlog checks in the evidence bundle.

## Result
- **Game day status: PASS (for fail-closed + recoverability objectives).**
