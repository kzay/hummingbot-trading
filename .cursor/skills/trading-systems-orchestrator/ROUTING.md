| edge, entry, exit, expectancy, position sizing, risk/reward | `strategy-design-quant` |
| backtest, walk-forward, slippage, fee model, overfitting | `backtesting-validation` |
| drawdown, kill switch, exposure cap, max loss | `trading-risk-management` |

| docker, vps, monitor, alert, deploy, rollback | `trading-infrastructure-deployment` |

If two or more categories match strongly, keep the orchestrator active and combine outputs.
